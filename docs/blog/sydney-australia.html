	      One of the benefits of staying in Sydney for a whole week was trying so many different restaurants. Here's a ranking of my favorite restaurants we tried on our trip: </p>

	    <div class="measure db center f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
	      <img class="db w-100 mt3 mt4-ns" src="../photos/Syd.jpg" alt="Hotcakes from Bills in Sydney Australia">
	        <h3 class="pt4 fw7 ttu tracked lh-title mt0 mb3">1. Bills (433 Liverpool St, Darlinghurst NSW 2010)</h3> 
				<p>My favorite meal we had in Australia and recommended to us by one of our Uber drivers! I had no idea Australia was world renowned for their breakfast but once we came to Bills, it all made sense.  The two items you have to get are the <b>ricotta hotcakes</b> and <b>scrambled eggs</b>. Their ricotta hotcakes are definitely some of the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. They're super fluffy, a little tart, and the honeycomb butter that comes with it just makes it that much better. The "Full Aussie" comes with their infamous scrambled eggs, sourdough toast, cumin roast tomato, bacon, miso mushrooms, pork, chilli and fennel sausage. The scrambled eggs are so buttery and fluffy. I couldn't stop eating them.
				</p>

	      
		<div class="measure db center f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
	      <img class="db w-100 mt3 mt4-ns" src="../photos/PB.jpg" alt="Dessert at Paper Bird">
	        <h3 class="pt4 fw7 ttu tracked lh-title mt0 mb3">2. Paper Bird (46A MacLeay St, Potts Point NSW 2011)</h3> 
				<p>My and my family's favorite dinner in Australia. We stopped by this very unassuming, slightly hole in the wall spot and were mind blown by everything. Their Australian take on Asian dishes sounded funny at first, but they were delicious. Our favorites were the <b>taco-yaki</b> (+1 for the word play) - an actual octopus taco in a rice flour tortilla, <b>shallot pancake</b> topped with jamon and shitake mushrooms, and shrimp brined <b>fried chicken</b>. If you have space, definitely get the <b>Japanese cheesecake</b> (pictured above). I don't know what they do with the kumquats, but they are so amazing. I would suggest making reservations just because it did end up getting a little crowded towards the end of our meal, which was around 8 pm. 
				</p>

		<div class="measure db center f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
	      <img class="db w-100 mt3 mt4-ns" src="../photos/Syd.jpg" alt="Hotcakes from Bills in Sydney Australia">
	        <h3 class="pt4 fw7 ttu tracked lh-title mt0 mb3">3. Ester Restaurant (46-52 Meagher St, Chippendale NSW 2008)</h3> 
				<p>Touted as one of Sydney's "hottest" restaurants, this place lives up to the hype. The restaurant itself is super hip and industrial, hidden in the middle of an alley. Everything we tried was great, but must try's were definitely the <b>raw kingfish</b> (correct me if i'm wrong, but I don't think we have that in the US), (homemade) <b>potato bread</b> with kefir cream, dashi jelly, and trout roe (so great altogether), <b>hanger steak</b>, and for dessert, <b>lemon meringue burnt pav</b>. They also have a set menu option. Pavlova is an Australian staple (so I've heard) and this one was definitely the best one I tried on our trip. As with any "hot" restaurant, definitely make a reservation if you're planning on stopping by here. 
				</p>

		<div class="measure db center f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
	      <img class="db w-100 mt3 mt4-ns" src="../photos/Wong.jpg" alt="Hotcakes from Bills in Sydney Australia">
	        <h3 class="pt4 fw7 ttu tracked lh-title mt0 mb3">4. Mr. Wong (3 Bridge Ln, Sydney NSW 2000)</h3> 
				<p>My dad liked this restaurant so much, he made us come twice in our one week there. A modern (and slightly expensive) take on dim sum in the middle of the business district, Mr Wong seriously surprised us. Our favorites were the <b>chive and roast duck dumpling, prawn and crispy dough rice roll, and wagyu and truffle puff</b>. I definitely recommend coming early or making reservations because seats fill up pretty quickly.   
				</p>

		<div class="measure db center f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
	      <img class="db w-100 mt3 mt4-ns" src="../photos/Momo.jpg" alt="Duck platter Momofuku">
	        <h3 class="pt4 fw7 ttu tracked lh-title mt0 mb3">5. Momofuku Seiobo (80 Pyrmont St, Pyrmont NSW 2009)</h3> 
				<p>Unlike the other Momofuku restaurants I've been to that are mostly Asian influenced, this one has a Caribbean flair. My family and I got the pre-theater tasting menu that came with four courses: a seafood starter, a meat starter, a main (which was this huge spread with duck, savory pancake, and other small sides), and a dessert. Everything was super unique and interesting - in a good way. The full tasting menu seemed amazing as well. (They brought out the lobster that they would cook for you to your table side.) I'd definitely try that next time.
